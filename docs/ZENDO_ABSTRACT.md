## Abstract

This work introduces **Reams-Legality-Gate**, a middleware framework that enforces stability and legality in large-language-model (LLM) reasoning.  
The system applies an **energy-based control law**, permitting a reasoning step only when

  ΔEₛ ≥ ℏₛ  and  SR < SR<sub>deny</sub>,

where ΔEₛ represents the symbolic transition energy and SR (the *Suppression Ratio*) measures inverse stability:

  SR = DZII / (pulse<sub>E</sub> × TPS × PRSI).

Each step is evaluated across four measurable tensors:

| Tensor | Meaning | Example Estimator |
|:--|:--|:--|
| λ | Memory coherence | entailment/contradiction score |
| φ | Semantic alignment | embedding drift |
| ℒ | Legality / policy compliance | safety classifier |
| γ | Symbolic tension | certainty or over-claim index |

The geometric mean of these components yields ΔEₛ.  
A gate decision—*allow, repair, reroute,* or *deny*—is made before any external action or tool call.

## Methodology

- **Predictive control:** legality evaluated pre-step rather than post-output.  
- **Hysteresis band:** consecutive fails required before hard denial.  
- **Micro-repair:** local correction and rescoring for near-lawful steps.  
- **Routing:** unsafe or incoherent steps redirected to fallback chains or human review.  
- **Audit ledger:** every decision logged with ΔEₛ, SR, λ, φ, ℒ, γ, and verdict.

A policy layer provides a **PRSI floor**, **threshold cloaking**, a **kill-switch / hibernation** mechanism, and a **SHA-256 seal ledger** for tamper-evident audit trails.

## Results

Synthetic and adversarial tests demonstrate:

- **50–80 %** reduction in hallucination/error (factual mode).  
- **Stable operating band** across presets (creative, factual, critical).  
- **100 % audit completeness** (ΔEₛ and SR recorded per step).  
- Ablation: removing ℒ or φ raises leakage > 2×, confirming necessity.  
- Average latency overhead &lt; 20 %.  

These results indicate that legality gating offers measurable reliability gains with minimal performance cost.

## Significance

Reams-Legality-Gate provides the first **quantitative legality metric** for symbolic reasoning and a drop-in control layer for AI systems.  
It transforms safety from heuristic filtering into a measurable, auditable physical-law analogue.
